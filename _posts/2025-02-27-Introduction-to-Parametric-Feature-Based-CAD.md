# Introduction and Scope

This page contains notes from the [Introduction to Parametric Feature-Based CAD course](https://learn.onshape.com/learn/course/introduction-to-parametric-feature-based-cad/parametric-feature-based-cad/introduction-to-3d-cad) available at [onshpae](#https://www.onshape.com/en/). This page essentially pulls together all of the course's *key takeaways*.

# 01 Course Introduction

## History of CAD

* Early CAD systems debuted in the 1960s, and were used primarily for 2D drafting.
* The 1990s introduced 3D parametric modeling, enhancing design flexibility and precision.
* Onshape transformed the landscape of computer-aided design with cloud-native 3D CAD.

## 2D vs 3D CAD

* Designers leverage Computer-Aided Design to both create and communicate the form and function of their parts and assemblies.
* With parametric three-dimensional CAD, each part becomes a three-dimensional model.
* Drawing views on two-dimensional drawings are linked to the three-dimensional model.

## Utilizing CAD Data

* Utilize drawings and other formats to aid in manufacturing.
* Simulation allows you to analyze the design for safety and integrity.
* Rendering creates high-quality images for marketing and sales teams.

# 02 Parametric Feature-Based CAD

## Introduction to 3D CAD

* 3-dimensional models are created by first developing 2-dimensional profiles and adding depth with features.
* Visualizing and planning a model streamlines the process and results in a better, more intelligent model.

## Design Intent

* Design intent is a combination of planning, organization, and anticipation built into your CAD design.
* Design intent influences the features you select, the parent/child relationships between them, and the parameters used to define them.
* Integrating your design intent into the model allows you to make changes more efficiently without compromising the overall design.

## View Projections

* 2D drawings require view projections to analyze, design, and precisely communicate complex shapes.
* Orthographic projection is a method to represent a 3D object by projecting its features onto perpendicular planes.
* First-angle and third-angle projections provide two different methods for projecting different views in relation to one another.

# 03 Knowledge Check

1. Which view projection is oriented such that all axes are at the same angle and scale, creating a balanced view of the object?
* Isometric

2. Onshape is a fully featured CAD software system that can be accessed completely from your web browser.
* True

3. The faces of a part are unfolded in the image below. Which of the 3D objects corresponds to the unfolded part?
* B

4. Which projection style is used in this drawing?
* Third Angle

5. Only one user may work in an Onshape document at a time.
* False
