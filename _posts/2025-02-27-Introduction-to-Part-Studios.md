# Introduction and Scope

This page contains notes from the [Introduction to Part Studios course](https://learn.onshape.com/learn/course/introduction-to-part-studios/) available at [onshpae](#https://www.onshape.com/en/). This page essentially pulls together all of the course's *key takeaways*.

# 01 Course Introduction
## Start a Part
* Onshape's use of sketches is more flexible than more traditional 3D CAD systems.
* Create features with a whole sketch, or portions of the sketch geometry.
* Sweep and Revolve inherit the same flexible behavior.

## Part Studio Interface
* This section shows the interactive UI with additional information.

## Filtering and Organizing the Feature List
* Folders help organize not only your Documents page, but Part Studios as well.
* To remove all contents from a folder, right-click the folder in the Feature list and select Unpack folder.
* Filter by name or type to further narrow down the Feature list.

# 02 Basic Features
## Extrude
* The Extrude feature extends a sketch along a specified direction to create depth.
* Select from multiple end conditions.
* Extrude solid parts, surfaces, or thin solids.

## Boolan Options
## Excercise: Control Arm
## Revolve
## Excercise: Reducer Coupling
